Project to make an image carousel using javascript sans jquery

There are three directories here:
1) from the example that Jonathan/instructor gave in class
2) I tried to work on the carousel using a different method with arrays
3) After noticing some bugs in that attempt, I asked Tan Nguyen for an
assist (he was successfully about to use an array on Friday). This is
what the third directory holds.

After implementing the array for the next/previous, I tried analyzing
his code for the animation and opacity examples.  Wasn't quite able to
get them to work.
